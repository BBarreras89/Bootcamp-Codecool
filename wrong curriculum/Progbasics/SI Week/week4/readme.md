Palindrome checker
JAVASCRIPT STRING OPERATION
30
Implement the isPalindrome method that checks whether a given input string is palindrome. Check the letters only. Upper or lower case, whitespace, and punctuation does not matter.

For palindrome input strings the return value is true, otherwise false.

The checker skips everything but the letters.

The checker is insensitive to letter case.

CRITERIA
Isogram checker
JAVASCRIPT STRING OPERATION
30
Implement the isIsogram method that checks whether a given input string is isogram. Check the letters only. Upper or lower case, whitespace, and punctuation does not matter.

For isogram input strings the return value is true, otherwise false.

The checker skips everything but the letters.

The checker is insensitive to letter case.

CRITERIA
Pangram checker
JAVASCRIPT STRING OPERATION
30
Implement the isPangram method that checks whether a given input string is pangram. Check the letters only. Upper or lower case, whitespace, and punctuation does not matter.

For pangram input strings the return value is true, otherwise false.

The checker skips everything but the letters.

The checker is insensitive to letter case.

CRITERIA
Anagram checker
JAVASCRIPT STRING OPERATION
30
Implement the isAnagram method that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. Check the letters only. Upper or lower case, whitespace, and punctuation does not matter.

For anagrammatic input strings the return value is true, otherwise false.

The checker skips everything but the letters.

The checker is insensitive to letter case.

CRITERIA
OPTIONAL TASK:
Blanagram checker
JAVASCRIPT STRING OPERATION
30
CONTROL FLOW ABSTRACTION
30
Implement the isBlanagram function that checks whether two given strings are blanagrams of each other. Check the letters only. Upper or lower case, whitespace, and punctuation does not matter.

For blanagrammatic input strings the return value is true, otherwise false.

The checker skips everything but the letters.

The checker is insensitive to letter case.

Hints
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as "rotator", "Anna", "My gym". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome.
An isogram (or heterogram) is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, such as "cornflakes", "subdermatoglyphic". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram.
A pangram is a sentence or other sequence of characters in which every letter of the alphabet is used at least once, such as "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram.
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once, such as "fairy tales" for "rail safety" or "eleven plus two" for "twelve plus one". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram.
A blanagram (from blank+anagram) is a word which is an anagram of another but for the substitution of a single letter, such as "chipotle" for "poetical" (anagrams after replacing "a" for "h"). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanagram.
